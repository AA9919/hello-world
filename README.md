My first Repository

Hi Data geeks!

I'm Atheek here and i'm starting to learn how to use github.
I'm a chemistry undergrad and i enrolled to coursera to follow my liking towards data science
I highly recommend coursera for any of you out there who would love to learn a new skill and expand your horizon
